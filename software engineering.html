<i><h1 style="background-color:pink;">Software Engineering Model</h1></i>
<u><h3> Waterfall Model</h3><u>
<p>The waterfall model depicts the software development process in a linear sequential flow; due to this, it is also referred to as a linear-sequential life cycle model, which indicates that any development process steps can start only after the previous one has finished. The stages are always done in this order and never overlap.</p>
<h3>Prototype Model</h3>
<p>Software Prototyping Model is a software development methodology that involves creating an initial prototype of the software product before developing the final product.The prototype is a working model of the software product that can be used to gather feedback and refine the design before the final product is developed.</p>
<h3>Spiral Model</h3>
<b><p>Spiral Model is a risk-driven software development process model.</b> It is a combination of waterfall model and iterative model. Spiral Model helps to adopt software development elements of multiple process models for the software project based on unique risk patterns ensuring efficient development process.</p>
